ATT-PIX is an advanced deep learning framework tailored for high-precision magnetic bead (MB) detection and ultrasensitive protein biomarker quantification in digital fluorescence microscopy immunoassay (DFMI). By synergistically integrating ATTBeadNet and PIX2PIX, this framework addresses critical bottlenecks in traditional DFMI—low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), inaccurate bead counting, and compromised image quality—enabling robust performance in biological and clinical microscopic image analysis.
